    <h6>Broccoli Alfredo Pasta Serving Suggestion</h6>

    <p>This broccoli Alfredo pasta is so pretty made with farfalle, also called bow-tie pasta. Of course, you may use fettuccine if you prefer. As a main dish, this serves 2; as a side, it serves 4. Add a salad, if you wish, and some bread. We love it as a side with grilled chicken or shrimp.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 ounces farfalle pasta</li>
                <li>2 cups fresh broccoli florets</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>fresh parsley sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Remove to a colander; reserve the pasta water for later use.</li>
                <li>Add broccoli to a microwave-safe container along with 1/4 cup water. Cover and cook on High until bright green and tender with a bite, about 4 minutes. Drain; season with salt. Keep warm.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet or saucepan over low heat. Stir in cream and allow to simmer, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add cheese and garlic, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted. Stir in nutmeg and remove from heat. sauce is too thick, stir in a bit of reserved pasta water. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>To serve, combine cooked pasta, cooked broccoli, and sauce. Garnish with fresh parsley sprigs, if desired.</li>
            </ol>
