> This is the last exercise under the html fundamentals lesson.

> I will be creating this website and will be building upon it in the next lessons.

> This will be a recipe website for the keto food that I love.

> By now, I have learned how to use and become somewhat comfortable with using the command line.

> I have learned how to use git and sync my project codes/files to github.

> I have learned how to create html documents and use html tags to create the base of my website.

> I have learned good coding practices, by following the instructions in The Odin Project curriculum.

> This will put what I've learned into practice.

> Note to self: You and this site are works in progress. Please be patient. KEEP MOVING UPWARD! NO MATTER WHAT!
